# MANA

## Purpose of the project

Leveraging statistic towards crypto assets trading. Mana strives to promote **Sniping** trading strategies proving new high performance tools to perform analysis and and transactional actions using Rust Programming Language on Solana blockchain.


### Bot Configuration 

TODO

### Protection mechanisms

Automatic trading capabilities on financial assets can increase performances but might face corner cases not managed by the bot itself. That's why protection mechanisms should be implement to prevent these cases.

#### Slippage Tolerance

The bot should be able to consider slippage to avoid afterward underperformance at sell.

#### Gas Fee

The bot should be able to consider transaction fees (or gas fees) to reduce impact over profitability.

#### Rug Pulls and Scams

Sniping involves significant risk as new tokens can be part of pump-and-dump schemes or rug pulls where developers withdraw liquidity after selling their tokens at high prices.
